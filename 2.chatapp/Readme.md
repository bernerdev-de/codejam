# Bernerdev Codejam


## Topic and task

> Create a working "online-shop". 
```
- store passwords and userdata
- store articles
- if a user fails three times giving in a password, his account will be suspended.
- The more features implemented from the real Ebay, the more points you get.
```

## Instructions
The app is supposed to be modeled after Ebay, but not an exact clone. Please, be creative, think about one or the other gimmick, which brings a smile to your face. 

## Deadline
> 8. August 2021, 12:00  CEST

## Rules
- No remotedatabases (only sqlite, or other local storage formats)
- Use only your own code(except libraries of course.)

## Organizer
This codejam is organized by bernerdev. If you want to take part in future jams, join our discord: [https://discord.gg/EGHy5tXBnj](https://discord.gg/EGHy5tXBnj)


## Into the depth

### Are there any prices?

No, that is not planned at the moment.

### How are the projects evaluated?

Projects are evaluated on the basis of user interface design, code quality, functionality.

### How do I get bonus points?

Here's where opinions differ. Most frameworks already provide support for user management, sessions and much more. However, a code jam is about proving your skills and creating a great project in a relatively short time. Therefore, people who write their own session and user management will get slightly more points than the people who use the framework implemented.
The implementation of group chats is also welcome.
* The bonus points are only for code that can be proven to have been written during the codejam and not before.

### Are frontend frameworks allowed?
Of course they are. However, this may result in a point deduction. 

Well, have fun and be creative.
