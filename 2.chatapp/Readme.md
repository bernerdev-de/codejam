## Into the depth

### Are there any prices?

No, that is not planned at the moment.

### How are the projects evaluated?

Projects are evaluated on the basis of user interface design, code quality, functionality.

### How do I get bonus points?

Here's where opinions differ. Most frameworks already provide support for user management, sessions and much more. However, a code jam is about proving your skills and creating a great project in a relatively short time. Therefore, people who write their own session and user management will get slightly more points than the people who use the framework implemented.
The implementation of group chats is also welcome.
* The bonus points are only for code that can be proven to have been written during the codejam and not before.

### Are frontend frameworks allowed?
Of course they are. However, this may result in a point deduction. 

Well, have fun and be creative.
